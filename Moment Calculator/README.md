This is a MATLAB calculator that uses the Mixed Triple method to determine the moment about a line of interest. The force components must be calculated by hand first. The 
calculator will take either points or vectors. It will ask for a force to be multiplied, just input "0" and press enter. The code will take either 3 or 5 input arguments
but nothing else. 

IMPORTANT: For this code to work, the unit vector calculator must be downloaded as well.
