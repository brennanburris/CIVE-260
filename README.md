# CIVE-260
These are MATLAB scripts I have created for my Statics class. 

Statics deals with quite a lot of math and when you have 3 vectors and a lot of variables, it can be easy to get confused. I will be using MATLAB in this class to ease the
process as well as to make it easier to complete the problems. My hope is that if I can understand the math well enough to create scripts, I will have a better understanding
overall. This is where I will be keeping my scripts that I create.
