This is a script I wrote to calculate the unit vector based on either a vector or points. This is a bit of an ongoing project, and I will be sure to update this as I change
the script.

To use this script, use unit(vector) or unit(point1, point2, etc). The algorithm will ask you if you input a vector or a point. From that point, it will calculate the unit vector. This code will work with up to 5 points. If you have some force you are trying to find in component form, you can enter it at that time. For example, if you have a force of 12N, simply input "12" and press the enter
key. The force in component form will be output. 

Rev1: Sept 7, 2021; 12:07 PM. Changed code to work with up to 5 points. One input will be treated as a vector.
