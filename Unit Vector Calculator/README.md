This is a script I wrote to calculate the unit vector based on either a vector or points. This is a bit of an ongoing project, and I will be sure to update this as I change
the script.

To use this script, use unit(vector) or unit(point1, point2). The algorithm will ask you if you input a vector or a point. From that point, it will calculate the unit vector.
If you have some force you are trying to find in component form, you can enter it at that time. For example, if you have a force of 12N, simply input "12" and press the enter
key. The force in component form will be output.
